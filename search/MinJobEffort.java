     * Design a schedule that completes n jobs in k days with minimal total "effort".
     * We define "effort" as the maximal job difficulty of a day, and "total effort"
     * as the sum of efforts of all days.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * - All jobs need to be completed in exactly k days, not less and not more.
     * - You can only process jobs in the given sequential order.
     * - There's at least 1 job scheduled every day.
     *
     * Examples:
     * [4,5,3,1,7,8], 3 -> return 14 with schedule: [4,5,3], [1], [7,8]
     * @param jobs a list of integers, each indicating the difficulty of the job
     * @param k number of days
     * @return the minimal effort
